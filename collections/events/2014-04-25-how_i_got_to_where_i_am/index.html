<p>A panel discussion featuring four local designers on different career paths and points discussing their journeys and decisions to getting where they are now (and even what&#39;s next!). We&#39;ll hear from a self employed creative, a designer in a small studio, a designer in a large agency, and a designer who launched their own creative business.</p>

<p>Whether you&#39;re a student wondering what the next step is or where you can go, considering a new direction in your career, or just love great stories and meeting fellow creatives - there&#39;s something for everyone!</p>
